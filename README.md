Spark-Core-Controlling-LEDs-over-the-Internet-App-Example
=========================================================

This is a very very simple app for iPhone that lets you control two LEDs connect to a Spark Core. The code is intended to work out at the box with the "CONTROL LEDS OVER THE 'NET" example on the Spark.io page under examples. 

Be aware that it's only a proof of concept project, I haven't done anything to the GUI and the two button event handlers do the same, only the params are different. I did this on purpose, so the beginner didn't got lost in fancy functionality
